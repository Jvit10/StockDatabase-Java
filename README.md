# StockDatabase-Java
This program as it stands right now is the base for a datbase and stock tracking application.
Currently it only has the base code for managing stocks from an imported file.
The end goal of this project is to have the application connected to a real time stock trade,
a database that will store userdata, and allow for manipulation of data in the database on the aplication.
